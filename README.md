# responder-base-classes
Package implementing base classes for use with the Responder web framework

# Thoughts
- this could be similar to Flask's extensions http://flask.pocoo.org/extensions/

## To-Do
- set up TravisCI
- move to pipenv?
- clean up print statements
- do I need any envparse functionality?
